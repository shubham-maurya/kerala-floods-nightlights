# kerala-floods-nightlights

This is an attempt to see whether month-level aggregated night lights, at the sub-district level, can give an impact estimate of the floods that devastated Kerala in 2018.

Uses night lights data from the VIIRS satellite (https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_dnb_composites.html), and rainfall data from the Pune IMD website (http://www.imdpune.gov.in/Seasons/Temperature/gpm/Rain_Download.html)

There are detailed files explaining how to handle each of these data sources, independent of the analysis.
